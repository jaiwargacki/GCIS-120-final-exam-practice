Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or Bacon's Law is a parlor game where players 
challenge each other to arbitrarily choose an actor and then connect them 
to another actor via a film that both actors have appeared in together, 
repeating this process to try to find the shortest path that ultimately 
leads to prolific American actor Kevin Bacon.

In this assignment you will use the provided classes, and a few classes you create 
in order to simulate a very small version of the game.

1. Create a class called Actor. An actor has a private name and getter method for it.
   Create an equals, a hashcode, and toString method for this class.

2. Create a class called Movie. A movie has a private name and a collection of actors. 
   Choose a representation for this data that is efficient and easy to work with.
   A movie should have a method that can add an actor to the collection and another 
   that checks to see if an actor is in the collection.

   Movie should be iterable so that a for each loop can be used to iterate through
   the movie's actors.

3. Open BaconGame.java. Using the code provided to you, complete the main method. 
   The graph should have actors, every actor should be connect to every 
   other actor they appear in the same movie.

4. Using the provided methods in AdjListGraph.java, create a method that determines if 
   there is a path between two actors. Demonstrate this method by calling it from the main.
