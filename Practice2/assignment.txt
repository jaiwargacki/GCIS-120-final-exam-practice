1.  Using the provided Book class, create a Bookshelf class that 
    holds a collection of ordered books. You can add books to the shelf, 
    remove books from the shelf, and print the books on the shelf.

    Choose a reasonable data structure that will hold the books.
    Look at the requirements below and choose the best data structure for the problem.
    
    Implement the following methods:
        // adds a book to the shelf
        public void addBook(Book book);
        // removes the last book on the shelf, returns the book that was removed
        public Book removeBook();
        // gets the book at the given index, return null if index is invalid
        public Book getBook(int index);

2.  Create a BookComparator class that implements the Comparator interface. 
    The compare method should compare two books by their page count.

    Add the sort() method to the Bookshelf class that uses the BookComparator 
    to sort the books on the shelf.

3.  Now create a BookshelfIterator class that implements the Iterator interface. 

4.  Create a main method that creates a Bookshelf, adds some books to it, sorts the books,
    and prints the books on the shelf one at a time using the BookshelfIterator.
